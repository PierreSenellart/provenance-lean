# Query-level counterexamples for the HAVING / JOIN correspondence

The correspondence between the possible-world semantics of `HAVING`
comparisons on `COUNT(*)` and the `JOIN`-based rewriting holds in
commutative m-semirings that are absorptive and whose `⊗` distributes over
`⊖`. This file witnesses, **at the level of queries evaluated on concrete
annotated databases** (not merely of the underlying algebraic identities),
that both hypotheses are needed. All facts are checked by `decide`.

The instances share the base relation `R(g, v)` of arity 2, grouped by the
first column; on the fused side the query is
the general `HAVING` site for `COUNT(*) op C` and on the join side
the queries are

* `Q₂^{≥1} = ε(Π_{#0}(R))`,
* `Q₂^{≥2} = ε(Π_{#0}(σ_{#0=#2 ∧ #1<#3}(R × R)))`, and
* `Q₂^{=1} = Q₂^{≥1} - Q₂^{≥2}`,

the tie-broken comparison of the general construction degenerating to the
plain `<` because the second attributes of the instances are pairwise
distinct. The fused operator's output carries the group key and the
aggregate value while the join queries return the key only, so the
comparison is on the multisets of annotations.

* **Distributivity is needed**
  (`HavingQueryCounterexamples.ChainFive.query_counterexample`): in the
  five-element chain semiring – absorptive, hence idempotent, but not
  `⊗`-over-`⊖` distributive (`ChainFive.not_mul_sub_left_distributive`) –
  with annotations `(mid, hi, hi)` on one group, `COUNT(*) = 1` yields
  annotation `hi` on the fused side but `𝟘` on the join side.

* **Absorptivity is needed**
  (`HavingQueryCounterexamples.TropicalZ.query_counterexample`): in the
  tropical semiring over `ℤ ∪ {∞}` – idempotent and distributive
  (`TropicalZ.mul_sub_left_distributive`) but not absorptive
  (`TropicalZ.not_absorptive_witness`) – with two occurrences annotated
  `trop (-1)` in one group, `COUNT(*) ≥ 1` yields annotation `trop (-2)`
  on the fused side but `trop (-1)` on the join side.
