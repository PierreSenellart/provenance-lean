# Semirings with monus

This file defines semirings with monus and introduces their main
properties.

Many semirings relevant for provenance can be equipped with a monus -
operator, resulting in what is called a semiring with monus, or
m-semiring. This is standard in semiring theory [amer1984equationally] and was
introduced in the setting of provenance semirings by Geerts and Poggi
[geerts2010database].

/-! ## Definition of a `SemiringWithMonus` -/

/-- A `SemiringWithMonus` is a naturally ordered semiring
with a monus operation that is compatible with the natural order.
We do not require the semiring to be necessarily commutative.

In addition to monus, the class carries a `δ : α → α` operator subject
to three axioms (`delta_zero`, `delta_natCast_pos`, and
`delta_regrouping`). This is the duplicate-eliminating support
operator used to interpret aggregation in the framework of
[Amsterdamer, Deutch & Tannen, *Provenance for aggregate queries*][amsterdamer2011aggregate],
mirroring ProvSQL's `Semiring::delta`. -/
class SemiringWithMonus (α : Type)
  extends Semiring α, PartialOrder α, IsOrderedAddMonoid α, CanonicallyOrderedAdd α, Sub α where
  monus_spec : ∀ a b c : α, a - b ≤ c ↔ a ≤ b + c
  /-- Duplicate-eliminating support operator. Sends `0` to `0` and any
  positive integer iterate of `1` to `1`. -/
  delta : α → α
  /-- `δ` sends `0` to `0`. -/
  delta_zero : delta 0 = 0
  /-- `δ` sends every positive integer iterate of `1` (i.e., every
  positive natural-number cast) to `1`. -/
  delta_natCast_pos : ∀ {n : ℕ}, 0 < n → delta ((n : α)) = 1
  /-- `δ` is invariant under regrouping a fine partition into a coarse one:
  computing δ on each fine group's sum, summing the results, and applying δ
  again yields the same value as summing all the fine groups directly and
  applying δ. Formally, `δ((Σᵢ δ(aᵢ))) = δ((Σᵢ aᵢ))` for any multiset of
  annotations.

  This strengthens the idempotence axiom of
  [Amsterdamer, Deutch & Tannen, *Provenance for aggregate queries*,
  Def. 3.6][amsterdamer2011aggregate]: idempotence is recovered by taking a
  singleton multiset (see `delta_idempotent`). The stronger form is the
  natural axiom for making grouped aggregation associative-up-to-equivalence
  under partition coarsening: re-grouping a fine partition to get a coarse
  one yields the same provenance as grouping directly. -/
  delta_regrouping : ∀ (s : Multiset α), delta (s.map delta).sum = delta s.sum

/-! ## Characteristic of idempotent semirings

In an idempotent semiring (`a + a = a`), every positive natural-number cast
collapses to `1`. With `1 ≠ 0` this yields `CharP K 0`. Note that this is
strictly weaker than `CharZero K`, which fails for idempotent semirings since
the cast `ℕ → K` is not injective. -/

/-- In a semiring with idempotent addition, the cast of any positive natural
number equals `1`. -/

/-- A nontrivial idempotent semiring has characteristic 0 in the `CharP` sense.
Unlike `CharZero`, this does not require the natural-number cast to be injective:
in an idempotent semiring every positive natural maps to `1`, but `1 ≠ 0` still
suffices to give `CharP K 0`. -/

/-! ## Generic constructions of `δ`

In the m-semirings used for provenance the `δ` operator is invariably
realized in one of two ways: as the identity (when the semiring is
idempotent, so every positive natural cast already equals `1`) or as the
indicator-of-nonzero (`a ↦ if a = 0 then 0 else 1`). The lemmas below
package the proofs of the three `δ` axioms for both candidates so each
concrete instance can plug them in directly. -/

/-- `δ := id` satisfies `delta_natCast_pos` in any idempotent semiring:
every positive natural-number cast collapses to `1`. -/
theorem delta_natCast_pos_id {K : Type} [Semiring K] (h : idempotent K)
    {n : ℕ} (hn : 0 < n) : (id ((n : K)) : K) = 1 :=
  natCast_pos_eq_one_of_idempotent h hn

/-- `δ := id` satisfies `delta_regrouping` in any semiring: both sides
unfold to `s.sum`. -/
theorem delta_regrouping_id {K : Type} [Semiring K] (s : Multiset K) :
    (id ((s.map id).sum) : K) = id s.sum := by simp

/-- The “indicator-of-nonzero” recipe: `δ a = 0` when `a = 0` and
`δ a = 1` otherwise. Captured abstractly so a single set of axioms can
serve all the concrete instances that use it (`ℕ`, `ℕ[X]`, Tropical,
Viterbi, Lukasiewicz). -/
structure IsDeltaIndicator {K : Type} [Zero K] [One K] (δ : K → K) : Prop where
  zero : δ 0 = 0
  nonzero : ∀ a, a ≠ 0 → δ a = 1

/-- Any `δ` matching the indicator recipe satisfies `delta_natCast_pos`
in a nontrivial semiring of characteristic 0 (in the `CharP` sense):
positive natural-number casts are nonzero, so `δ` sends them to `1`. -/

/-- Any `δ` matching the indicator recipe satisfies `delta_regrouping`

every summand is, so applying `δ` after summing indicators agrees with
applying `δ` after summing the original values. -/

/-! ## Existence of a `δ`-like operator

This is the abstract counterpart of the `SemiringWithMonus` δ-axioms: we
characterise, in an arbitrary nontrivial semiring (no order assumed), when
a function `δ : K → K` satisfying `δ 0 = 0`, `δ ((n : K)) = 1` for `0 < n`,
and idempotence `δ (δ a) = δ a` can exist. The class axiom
`delta_regrouping` is strictly stronger than idempotence, so the iff
below should be read as a statement about how much of the ProvSQL δ
interface is consistent with a given characteristic, not as a full
existence proof for the class axiom. (Constructing a witness for
`delta_regrouping` itself requires more structure: in a canonically
ordered semiring the indicator works, see `delta_regrouping_indicator`.) -/

/-- In any nontrivial semiring, a function `δ : K → K` satisfying `δ 0 = 0`,
`δ ((n : K)) = 1` for every positive natural cast `n`, and idempotence
`δ (δ a) = δ a` exists if and only if `K` has characteristic `0` in the
`CharP` sense. The forward direction follows because `δ 0 = 0` and
`δ ((n : K)) = 1` are inconsistent when `(n : K) = 0` for some `0 < n` (it
would force `0 = 1`); idempotence plays no role here. The backward direction
defines `δ` as the indicator of being nonzero, which is automatically a
fixed point of itself.

Note that the `δ` operator is not uniquely determined by these axioms: they
only pin its values on the image of `ℕ` (plus the requirement that any
chosen value be a fixed point of `δ`). Two typical choices are δ as the
indicator of being nonzero (`δ x = if x = 0 then 0 else 1`, used in the
backward direction below) and, in an idempotent semiring, δ as the identity
(since every positive natural cast then equals `1`, see
`natCast_pos_eq_one_of_idempotent`). -/

/-! ## Commutative `SemiringWithMonus`s

`SemiringWithMonus` is intentionally not assumed to be commutative; however, every
provenance semiring used in this library is in fact commutative, and the algebraic
identities that drive HAVING-style aggregate provenance (see `Provenance.Having`)
require it. `CommSemiringWithMonus` packages a `SemiringWithMonus` together with
the commutativity axiom, producing a `CommMonoid` instance whose `Mul` matches
the one already supplied by `SemiringWithMonus`, so no `Mul` diamond appears when
`Finset.prod` is used.

/-- A `CommSemiringWithMonus` is automatically a `CommMonoid`, sharing its
